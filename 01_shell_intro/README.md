Hi everyone,

This Repo is based on what I learned from the Shell Scripting course
ran by SHARCNET between May 25th and may 27th 2021.

This course taught the basics of shell scripting and I will report here
what I learned.

The shell scripts you will see here are refferred to the flights.zip
file which, if extracted, will give a series of .igc files with useful
information in it. The aim of this few examples is to be able to manipulate 
files and contents in the most efficient way.

Here you will find how to:

- Extract specific information from a file
- Loop through the file to find information
- Rename all the files using a custom command
- Print to screen specific information using nested loops
